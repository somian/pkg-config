### OpenBSD pkg-config implemented in Perl

The software in this repository started as a simple fork-clone of [the code repository at
](https://github.com/jasperla "Github jasperla") apparently a non-canonical GitHub space.
The code appears to be brought from OpenBSD cvs management directly into that repo with
no changes. The latest commit there was
[@dde2548](https://github.com/jasperla/pkg-config/commit/dde2548e24b569836ffc4dfaca70e28f1d232c63).

#### Installation

The runtime library for this implementation of _pkgconfig_ in Perl, is **OpenBSD/PkgConfig.pm**. 

Any installer utility's task is to place a executable script (_pkg-config_) in the right place
and to put *OpenBSD/PkgConfig.pm* in the right place. A simple Makefile was provided upstream.
We've added a GNUmakefile that is able to query the Perl in PATH and install file to the more
often predictably correct places (but likely not always). This is very simple GNU make code.

No attempt is made to adjust the hashbang first line of the script file.
